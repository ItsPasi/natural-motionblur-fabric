    <h1 align="center">Natural Motion Blur</h1>
</p>

This motion blur mod aims to closely mimic human vision motion blur by blending frames together, reducing stroboscopic effects and making motion appear more fluent.

It is highly recommended to use the default strength value together with a framerate limit that matches your monitor's refresh rate. Best results are achieved by using V-sync.

The config GUI can be accessed via these commands: ```/motionblur``` ```/mb``` <br/>
You can also do ```/motionblur <strength>``` or ```/mb <strength>``` to set the strength of the blur directly.

This mod is **not** compatible with Iris shaders.
